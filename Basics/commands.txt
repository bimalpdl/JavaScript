npm i prompt-sync     => library to ask for user input in terminal
after installing, we'll need to put :
"let prompt = require('prompt-sync')();"    // you can use any word as variable other than the reserved for JS ones.
on top of the file you're going to use the 'prompt()' mehtod,  then you can use prompt() like this:

let age = prompt("Enter your age: ");    // prompts for user input age
the input got from promt is always string.
